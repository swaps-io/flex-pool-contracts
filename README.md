## Description

### Overview

Flex Pool Protocol allows solvers to [take](#take) the available pool [asset](#asset) on one chain and return it on
another chain via a [give](#give) operation. These operations are carried out through a variety of secure whitelisted
adapters to 3rd-party [providers](#providers).

Liquidity providers [deposit](#deposit) pool asset for protocol to cover the solver operations. In return, providers
receive pool "shares", that represent their participation in pool liquidity. A share is backed by more assets as the
pool protocol collects [fees](#tuner) from the solvers. Providers can [withdraw](#withdraw) the original asset back
from the "shares" as desired.

For a single logical asset, there is one pool on every supported chain. Pools are connected with each other by the
[infrastructure](#infrastructure). Liquidity can be moved within these per-asset infrastructure-isolated enclaves with
the take and give operations. If liquidity is not returned to its original chain naturally during these operations, the
[rebalance](#rebalance) mechanism provides an incentive for an arbitrary solver to restore the liquidity manually.

### Infrastructure

Main [`FlexPool`](contracts/pool/FlexPool.sol) contract contains controlled whitelist of all allowed [take](#take)
[providers](#providers) with attached [tuners](#tuner). Each taker is designed to guarantee a secure cross-chain
transfer of required liquidity amount between pools in one logical [asset](#asset) enclave.

Taker contract is bound to a specific 3rd-party provider. It's also often limited by deployment parameters to support
a single chain-to-chain channel for better security - especially when it needs to validate actions of a helper
[giver](#give) contract on the other chain. It follows that there may be several instances of one provider in the
router - one for every enclave chain.

Some provider implementations require verification of a certain event that occurred on the other chain to ensure
soundness of the take (or any related) operation. For the verification purpose, such a provider employs event
[verifier](#verifier) contract.

### Operations

Pool implementation is based on tokenized vault standard [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626).
It's recommended to look into it before diving into the pool operation specifics.

The `deposit` function allows liquidity providers to deposit desired amount of the pool [asset](#asset).
Specified amount of the asset is _received_ from the caller address, so sufficient
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) allowance must be provided for the pool
contract prior the call (various permit multicall options are supported).

Depositing asset mints "shares" to `receiver` address. The `previewDeposit` function can be used to pre-calculate the
amount of minted shares. Minted shares represent liquidity provider participation in pool. These shares are backed by
_at least_ deposited asset amount. As pool collects protocol fee, the collected fee is distributed between all the
providers proportionally.

Shares behave exactly like usual ERC-20 token (sharing the address with the pool contract address), but have different
number of decimals than the managed asset, [permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) support, and accepted by
the pool for [withdraw](#withdraw) operation to convert back to the asset.

While `maxDeposit` function is presented as part of the [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)
implementation, there is _no actual limit_ implemented in the pool protocol logic. TODO

The `withdraw` function allows to burn [deposit](#deposit)-minted shares of `owner` and get asset these shares are
currently backed by. Amount of the resulting withdraw asset can be checked using `previewWithdraw`.

Since shares represented by special pool token, withdrawing does not require ERC-20 allowance provisioning. However,
when an arbitrary account has shares allowance provided by `owner`, they can call withdraw asset on owner's behalf.

The `maxWithdraw` function only limits withdraw amount by owner's shares balance.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> While it's possible to withdraw entire shares balance instantly, it's _not guaranteed_ that all withdrawn assets will
> be sent to `receiver` immediately. TODO: update w/ available assets

This is due to the fact that pool liquidity can currently be taken to another chain and not given back to this chain
yet. TODO: update w/ available assets
