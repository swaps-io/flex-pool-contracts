## Description

### Overview

Flex Pool Protocol allows solvers to [take](#take) the available pool [asset](#asset) on one chain and return it on
another chain via a [give](#give) operation. These operations are carried out through a variety of secure whitelisted
adapters to 3rd-party [providers](#providers).

Liquidity providers [deposit](#deposit) pool asset for protocol to cover the solver operations. In return, providers
receive pool "shares", that represent their participation in pool liquidity. A share is backed by more assets as the
pool protocol collects [fees](#tuner) from the solvers. Providers can [withdraw](#withdraw) the original asset back
from the "shares" as desired.

For a single logical asset, there is one pool on every supported chain. Pools are connected with each other by the
[infrastructure](#infrastructure). Liquidity can be moved within these per-asset infrastructure-isolated enclaves with
the take and give operations. If liquidity is not returned to its original chain naturally during these operations, the
[rebalance](#rebalance) mechanism provides an incentive for an arbitrary solver to restore the liquidity manually.

### Infrastructure

Main [`FlexPool`](contracts/pool/FlexPool.sol) contract contains controlled whitelist of all allowed [take](#take)
[providers](#providers) with attached [tuners](#tuner). Each taker is designed to guarantee a secure cross-chain
transfer of required liquidity amount between pools in one logical [asset](#asset) enclave.

Taker contract is bound to a specific 3rd-party provider. It's also often limited by deployment parameters to support
a single chain-to-chain channel for better security - especially when it needs to validate actions of a helper
[giver](#give) contract on the other chain. It follows that there may be several instances of one provider in the
router - one for every enclave chain.

Some provider implementations require verification of a certain event that occurred on the other chain to ensure
soundness of the take (or any related) operation. For the verification purpose, such a provider employs event
[verifier](#verifier) contract.

### Operations

Pool implementation is based on tokenized vault standard [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626).
It's recommended to look into it before diving into the pool operation specifics.

The `deposit` function allows liquidity providers to deposit desired amount of the pool [asset](#asset).
Specified amount of the asset is _received_ from the caller address, so sufficient
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) allowance must be provided for the pool
contract prior the call (various permit multicall options are supported).

Depositing asset mints "shares" to `receiver` address. The `previewDeposit` function can be used to pre-calculate the
amount of minted shares. Minted shares represent liquidity provider participation in pool. These shares are backed by
_at least_ deposited asset amount. As pool collects protocol fee, the collected fee is distributed between all the
providers proportionally.

Shares behave exactly like usual ERC-20 token (sharing the address with the pool contract address), but have different
number of decimals than the managed asset, [permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) support, and accepted by
the pool for [withdraw](#withdraw) operation to convert back to the asset.

While `maxDeposit` function is presented as part of the [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)
implementation, there is _no actual limit_ implemented in the pool protocol logic.

The `withdraw` function allows to burn [deposit](#deposit)-minted shares of `owner` and get asset these shares are
currently backed by. Amount of the resulting withdraw asset can be checked using `previewWithdraw`.

Since shares represented by special pool token, withdrawing does not require ERC-20 allowance provisioning. However,
when an arbitrary account has shares allowance provided by `owner`, they can call withdraw asset on owner's behalf.

The `maxWithdraw` function only limits withdraw amount by owner's shares balance. However, it's _not guaranteed_ that
currently [available](#available-assets) pool assets are sufficient to cover a withdraw. The liquidity _may be moved_
to another chain so the withdrawer should wait for it to be _given_ back to the chain of interest.

While `withdraw` function _reverts_ when amount greater than available in the pool is attempted, additional
`withdrawAvailable` function allows to withdraw "as much as available" from the pool - up to the specified `amount`.
The withdraw asset _clamp_ to the available amount can be previewed with the `clampAssetsToAvailable` view.

The `take` function is the main point of obtaining the pool [asset](#asset) for solvers. When called, it first validates
the requested [`taker`](#taker) contract to be whitelisted and extracts [`tuner`](#tuner) assigned to it. The tuner
calculates how much the solver should [give](#give) assets back to pool for the requested `assets` to take. The result
is always at least `assets` + `protocolAssets`, plus additional `rebalanceAssets` if it's _positive_.

The `protocolAssets` value is added to [total](#total-assets) assets managed by the pool. In other words, this is a
commission that the solver pays to liquidity providers for the usage. The underlying ERC-4626 mechanism
[distributes](#deposit) the collected fee proportionally to pool "shares" balance of the providers.

The `rebalanceAssets` value represents [equilibrium](#equilibrium-assets) restore _fee_ when _positive_ - i.e. solver
_pays_ for changing the liquidity balance in a direction _unfavorable_ for the pool. When the liquidity change is
_favorable_, `rebalanceAssets` have _negative_ value - i.e. solver is _paid_ here for [rebalance](#rebalance). This
rebalance payment is transferred as _surplus_ to the `taker` contract along with the requested `assets`.

> [!TIP]
>
> Check out [rebalance](#rebalance) section for info on how tuner's `rebalanceAssets` should be taken into account when
> checking pool asset availability for a `take`.

The `taker` ensures that the total amount of the received assets is sufficient to guarantee at least _give_ assets for
the pool on a target chain. The details of this security validation logic depend on implementation of a specific taker
[provider](#providers). After validation, and, usually, transfer of _minimal_ needed asset to underlying protocol, a
take provider transfers unspent assets surplus to the take solver.

#### Give

A give operation serves for returning liquidity to pool [enclave](#infrastructure). At its core, this operation is as
simple as [asset](#asset) ERC-20 token transfer directly to the pool contract address.

However, depending on a [taker](#taker) [provider](#providers) solver is planning to use for the [`take`](#take)
operation, there can be an extra _giver_ contract that wraps this simple transfer into additional logic, which is
required for validation on the _taker_ side. Solver is obligated to use such a contract according to the corresponding
provider's docs. If misused, this may result in _asset loss_ in pool enclave.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The direct transfer of managed* asset to the pool address _will not_ distribute it between pool share holders like
> in traditional ERC-4626 implementation. This asset amount will be included into enclave's total liquidity balance.
>
> If transfer is done incorrectly, there could be a situation when solver cannot proof eligibility for the _take_
> operation, effectively _gifting_ their asset to the enclave system. This liquidity will be available for future
> takes within the enclave, but will _never be withdrawable_ back from it.
>
> \* - Unmanaged assets can be rescued by pool controller.

#### Rebalance

Pool liquidity shifts from one chain to another as [take](#take) and [give](#give) operations take place. To ensure
liquidity [equilibrium](#equilibrium-assets) is balanced, i.e. [available](#available-assets) assets are close to the
[total](#total-assets) managed assets amount, pool provides rebalance incentivization mechanism.

The rebalance logic is integrated into the [take](#take) function. As can be seen from the description in the
corresponding section, the arguments for a _rebalance take_ are the same as for a regular one - i.e. even regular
solver can benefit from restoring liquidity.

A solver that _specializes_ on liquidity rebalancing would monitor [tuners](#tuner) of providers they are interested in.
These can be providers that require to bring own liquidity on other chain first or bridge-like providers that consume
liquidity on one chain and return it on another chain. When monitoring, solver looks for _negative_ `rebalanceAssets`
and ensure that the paid amount is sufficient to cover associated expenses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The sign of the `rebalanceAssets` value indicates:
> - _positive (+)_ - solver _pays_ specified amount to the [rebalance](#rebalance-assets) reserve
>   ([equilibrium](#equilibrium-assets)-unfavorable take)
> - _negative (-)_ - solver is _paid_ specified amount (in absolute value) to the rebalance reserve
>   (equilibrium-favorable take)

When `rebalanceAssets` value is _positive_, the corresponding amount of asset is moved from the
[available](#available-assets) liquidity to the [rebalance](#rebalance-assets) reserve. This is due to the fact that
assets reserved for rebalance are held on balance separably - ready to be paid in the _negative_ assets scenario.
So when checking `assets` availability in pool for a `take` operation, _positive_ `rebalanceAssets` should be taken
into account as well.

> [!TIP]
>
> Example #1 - _positive_ `rebalanceAssets`:
> - Solver requests `take` of `1_000_000_000` assets
> - Taker tuner returns:
>   - `protocolAssets` value of `37_000_000`
>   - `rebalanceAssets` value of `+42_000_000`
> - The transaction success depends on the pool [available assets](#available-assets):
>   - less than `1_000_000_000` - obvious failure ‚ùå
>   - from `1_000_000_000` to less than `1_042_000_000` - still fail ‚ùå
>   - from `1_042_000_000` and greater - sufficient ‚úÖ
> - `1_000_000_000` is transferred from pool to taker contract
> - Taker ensures that provided `1_000_000_000` will bring at least `1_079_000_000` on other chain

> [!TIP]
>
> Example #2 - _negative_ `rebalanceAssets`:
> - Solver requests `take` of `1_000_000_000` assets
> - Taker tuner returns:
>   - `protocolAssets` value of `37_000_000`
>   - `rebalanceAssets` value of `-42_000_000`
> - Pool available assets:
>   - less than `1_000_000_000` - failure ‚ùå
>   - from `1_000_000_000` and greater - sufficient ‚úÖ
> - `1_042_000_000` is transferred from pool to taker contract
>   - `42_000_000` comes from [rebalance](#rebalance-assets) reserve, which is separate from available assets
> - Taker ensures that provided `1_042_000_000` will bring at least `1_037_000_000` on other chain
>   - calculates that `1_012_000_000` is sufficient - the `30_000_000` surplus is transferred to the solver

Asset is [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) token contract address that's managed
by current pool. Pool can receive and send the managed asset for the purpose of providing [deposit](#deposit),
[withdraw](#withdraw), [take](#take), or [give](#give) functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> An asset managed by [_enclave_](#infrastructure)-connected pools on different chains must be the same _logical asset_,
> i.e. should have the same market value, equivalent symbol, etc on every supported chain. Different token decimals
> _are supported_ - on individual [taker](#taker)'s side.

>
> - Returns:
>   - `totalManagedAssets` (`uint256`) - total amount of managed asset
>
> ---

Total amount of [asset](#asset) that is managed by current pool.

Asset becomes managed when [deposited](#deposit) by liquidity provider and remain there until [withdrawn](#withdraw).
Total amount of asset can only grow as protocol fees are collected by [take](#take) operations.

Since asset can be moved to other chain as part of the borrow flow, [current assets](#current-assets) can differ from
this value by [equilibrium assets](#equilibrium-assets).

#### Current Assets

>
> - Returns:
>   - (`uint256`) - current amount of asset
>
> ---

Total amount of [asset](#asset) that is presented on current pool balance.

This amount includes both [available](#available-assets) and [rebalance](#rebalance-assets) assets.

Pool's current assets can be topped up via direct transfer to contract address.

#### Equilibrium Assets

>
> ---

Amount of [asset](#asset) the [available balance](#available-assets) is offset from equilibrium, i.e. from
[total managed amount](#total-assets). Since pool can temporary either have extra assets or lack some of them,
the equilibrium assets can be positive or negative respectively.
